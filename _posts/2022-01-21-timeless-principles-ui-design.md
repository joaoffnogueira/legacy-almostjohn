> According to Joe Natoli

AFFORDANCE: The physical characteristics of an element that suggest and influence how it’s used.

CLOSURE: With enough visual information, we fill in the missing parts to create a whole object or experience.

CONSISTENCY: Usability increases when similar parts of a system are designed in similar ways.

CONTINUATION: The eye follows lines, curves, or a sequence of shapes to determine relationships between elements.

ENCLOSURE: Things appearing to have a boundary around them are perceived to be grouped — and related.

FIGURE-GROUND RELATIONSHIP: The order in which we perceive and assign importance to elements in the visual field.

FITTS’ LAW: The time required to move to a target area depends on the distance and size of that target area.

OCCAM’S RAZOR: The simplest solution is usually the best solution.

HICKS’ LAW: Every additional choice increases the time required to make a decision.

PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE: Only necessary or requested information is displayed at any given time.
